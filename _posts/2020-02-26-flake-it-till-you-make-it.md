There are some very natural questions that arise when consider coin flips. That is,

Suppose you flip a coin twice. What's the expected number of heads? Tails?

How many coin flips do we need until we expect 3 heads? 3 tails? $n$ heads?

Suppose we get a get a dollar for every ead we flip, and lose a dollar for every tail we flip. If we start at $1000, how many flips until we go broke or reach $2000? Are we guaranteed to eventually go broke?

Using these ideas, we can generate some key ideas in random variables - especially martingale theory and distribution theory.
